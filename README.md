This is actually my resume website. it is a little outdated but I figure its better to use this than some "example" site. There is a base index with three subpages in a secondary folder.

root
|
|--------index.html  # the base landing page and resume summmary
|
|--------README.md
|
|--------Resumes/    # some resumes that may be down loaded form the site
|
|--------HTML/       # the subpages
|         |----------/projects.html
|         |----------/references.html
|         |----------/resume.html

|--------CSS/        # the style script for the site
